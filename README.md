# Web Developer Candidate Test

I created this project to complete a series of web development/coding tasks as part of a recruitment process for a role as a junior web developer. My intention in creating a repository is to make it easier for the company to access and assess my work. I have attempted to remove any potentially confidential info/identifying information about the company before creating the repo. I have included the main list of questions below and instructions on how to run the app and where to find my code/answers.

<!-- include unit testing if possible/visualisation of code test file, pages for other challenges JS etc if poss, instructions on how to run, deploy to heroku -->


# Questions
## 1. GIT Knowledge
We use GIT heavily in everyday tasks and it’s integral for the maintenance of the business. Although most IDE’s will have GIT integrated, it’s good to know what the IDE is actually doing and how it works.

### 1.1 Write GIT CLI commands for the following

1. Change to your working directory (for demonstrative purposes, the working directory is “/Users/exampleuser/Desktop/sites/company2018“
2. Check the status of the repo and current branch
3. Perform a pull from origin master
4. Create a new branch
5. Checkout the branch you created
6. Add all modified files and commit a change
7. Push your branch to origin
8. Good news! Your changes were reviewed and accepted in a pull request. Now you can delete your local branch, it’s now part of master. Write the git command to delete the branch you created.

### 1.2 Write a typical workflow for pushing new code into the master branch with Git.


## 2. Something is broken! What do we do?
Part of a great workflow and team environment should be encouraging people to help each other when they need it.

Scenario
Our sales period is approaching within the next week. Discount codes will go live in less than 5 days and all promotional ads/content will start to flow soon. But there’s a problem! For some reason the UK and US company website aren’t generating sales for the main product. That’s our flagship product!

Everyone is panicking and it’s up to us, the Web team, to investigate potential bugs/issues as to why this may be happening.




## 3. JavaScript
Download the following JS file and answer the questions within.

Please find my solutions within webdevtest/challenges/JSChallenges.js
<!-- instructions to run -->

## 4. Development

### Instructions to Run My App/Solution to this Section:
#### I have created a React app to complete this question. To run this app and see my solutions:

1. Clone this repository with git, eg run the command `git clone`
2. Change into project directory, eg `cd webdevtest`
3. Install any dependencies with the command `npm i`
<!-- 4. should be minimal -->
5. Run `Yarn start` in a terminal to run app locally in browser
   
   <!-- or npm start -->
   <!-- link to deployed app if possible -->
<!-- yarn test to run tests -->

Recreate this as best you can:
(see other document for video link)

You can use frameworks like Vue or React (vue preferable but use whatever framework you feel most comfortable with). Minimize other javascript libraries.

### Page hero:
Create Page hero using a mobile first approach. Tips: try to only load the applicable elements to the applicable screen size.

(See other documents for links)

Font-family: ‘Helvetica Neue’

Mobile video: 

Desktop video:

Company logo:

#### Optional Challenge:
create a burger nav menu for mobile which has animations and states

### Greeting Card Text Generator:
Create a greeting card text generator where the user fills in a form and it renders the html. Form inputs not filled will not appear. Use modern html and no inline styling for rendered greeting card. Mobile first but not as necessary as the first example.

#### Optional Challenge: 
render raw html of the rendered signature.
